    "Since the dawn of civilization, our technology has come a long way. Now anyone with a smartphone device and an internet connection can connect and communicate freely. This is very positive but having many people accessing the social world leads to mixed opinions and words thrown at each other. It is easier to type something cruel than to say it to someone's face. This leads to people commenting or talking negatively with cruel comments, harsh words, racist comments, insulting expressions, and many more. This is called hate speech. The barrier that can divide people from expressing hatred through comments and texts can be hate speech or offensive language detectors and ban them.\n",
    "This is why we need to come up with hate speech detectors that can easily erase the hate speeches and make the social world a little bit cleaner."

    "Hate speech detection is an important tool for combating hate speech, particularly on social media. Several methods have been developed for the task, including a recent proliferation of machine-learning and deep-learning model-based approaches. Because hate speech data sets are rarely clean, they must be pre-processed before classification algorithms can detect hate speech. Different machine learning models have different strengths, making some better than others at certain tasks like detecting hate speech. Some models are more accurate than others in terms of efficiency. It is critical to employ various models and compare their performance in order to identify the best one for hate speech detection. Pre-training methods have grown in popularity in recent years, and it is important to test whether they work well with hate speech detection algorithms. It is also important to see how hate speech detection models can be used to address domain changes."

    "Our project is a combination of several subtasks and processes. Starting with loading the dataset into the pandas dataframe, we first oversampled the dataset to combat discrimination among the different classes. Then we applied text preprocessing to get rid of unhelpful and noisy data. Moving on, we applied feature engineering to vectorize the raw text data. Following this, we split the dataset into train and test sets and fed the train data into our models. Finally, we ran accuracy metrics to measure and compare the performance of all three algorithms."
